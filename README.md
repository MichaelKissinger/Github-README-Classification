# Github-README-Classification

Github is one of the most popular code repository platforms out there, and README files in a repository are a
critical component that allow the author/developer of the repository to describe its contents. Even though
Github README files are suppose to provide sufficient information about the contents of the repository, it is
not always the case.

In this paper, we referenced the work that was done in the paper Categorizing the Content of Github
README Files. The purpose of this paper was to add 1000 new data points and extend the original
paper’s dataset. Afterwards, we would train our dataset on different algorithms to see if the resulting models
improved on the metrics presented in the original paper’s results.

This repo contains all code and the final report used in our paper.
